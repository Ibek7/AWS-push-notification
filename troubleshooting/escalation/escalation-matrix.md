# Escalation Matrix and Procedures

## 🎯 Purpose
This document defines when and how to escalate issues in the AWS Push Notifications system, ensuring appropriate response times and proper communication channels.

## 🚨 Severity Levels

### 🔥 Critical (P0)
**Definition:** Complete service outage or severe security incident
**Examples:**
- Push notification system completely down
- Data breach or unauthorized access
- Major AWS service outage affecting our system
- Firebase authentication completely failing

**Response Requirements:**
- **Response Time:** Immediate (0-15 minutes)
- **Resolution Time:** 1-4 hours
- **Escalation:** Immediate to on-call engineer and management
- **Communication:** Page primary on-call, notify management, create incident room

### ⚠️ High (P1)
**Definition:** Significant functionality impacted, affecting most users
**Examples:**
- High error rate (>5%) in notifications
- Performance degradation (>10s response times)
- Partial service functionality loss
- Security vulnerability discovered

**Response Requirements:**
- **Response Time:** 15-30 minutes
- **Resolution Time:** 4-12 hours
- **Escalation:** Contact on-call engineer
- **Communication:** Slack notification, email to team leads

### 📋 Medium (P2)
**Definition:** Limited functionality impacted, affecting some users
**Examples:**
- Intermittent failures (<5% error rate)
- Performance issues (3-10s response times)
- Non-critical feature not working
- Monitoring alerts triggering

**Response Requirements:**
- **Response Time:** 1-4 hours
- **Resolution Time:** 12-48 hours
- **Escalation:** Standard team notification
- **Communication:** Ticket creation, team Slack channel

### 📝 Low (P3)
**Definition:** Minor issues with minimal user impact
**Examples:**
- Documentation needs updates
- Non-urgent feature requests
- Cosmetic UI issues
- Optimization opportunities

**Response Requirements:**
- **Response Time:** Next business day
- **Resolution Time:** 1-2 weeks
- **Escalation:** Standard backlog prioritization
- **Communication:** Regular team meetings

## 🏃‍♂️ Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate

#### Automatic Escalation Triggers
- **Time-based:** No response within defined SLA
- **Severity increase:** Issue impact grows beyond initial assessment
- **Resource needs:** Requires skills/access beyond current responder
- **External factors:** Vendor support needed, management decision required

#### Manual Escalation Situations
- **Technical complexity:** Issue beyond team's expertise
- **Resource constraints:** Need additional team members
- **Customer impact:** High-profile customer affected
- **Security concerns:** Potential security implications
- **Vendor issues:** Third-party service problems

### How to Escalate

#### Internal Escalation
1. **Update ticket/incident** with current status and reason for escalation
2. **Contact next level** via appropriate communication method
3. **Provide context** including timeline, actions taken, current impact
4. **Transfer ownership** or establish clear collaboration model
5. **Continue monitoring** and providing updates

#### External Escalation (Vendor Support)

**AWS Support Escalation:**
```bash
# Create AWS support case
aws support create-case \
  --subject "URGENT: Push Notification Service Issue" \
  --service-code "amazon-sns" \
  --severity-code "high" \
  --category-code "technical" \
  --communication-body "Detailed description of issue including error messages, timestamps, and impact"

# For critical issues, follow up with phone call
# Business Support: 1-800-XXX-XXXX
# Enterprise Support: Dedicated phone number
```

**Firebase Support Escalation:**
1. Log into [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Navigate to Support section
3. Create new support request with:
   - **Priority:** Critical/High based on severity
   - **Category:** Cloud Messaging
   - **Description:** Detailed issue description
   - **Project ID:** Include Firebase project ID
4. For paid plans, use phone support if available
